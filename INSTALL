INSTALL file for the VLC media player

Mac OS X and BeOS users should read the documentation available at: 
http://developers.videolan.org/vlc/

Configuring VLC
===============

A typical way to configure VLC is:

   ./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-gnome

See `./configure --help' for more information.

If you intend to debug stuff, you may want to compile with debugging
symbols:

   make distclean ; ./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-gnome --enable-debug


Building VLC
============

Have a look at the generated Makefile.opts file, you may want to choose
which modules will be compiled as plugins, and which ones will remain in
the core application. The configure script tries to guess for you.

Once configured, run `make' to build VLC.


Installing and running VLC
==========================

You can install the VLC and its plugins by typing:

   make install

But you don't need to install it if you don't want to; VLC can be launched
from the current directory as well:

   ./vlc


Building packages
=================

To build a Debian package, you may use:

   dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -us -uc


To build RedHat packages, use:

   rpm -ba vlc.spec

To build an ipkg package (iPAQ familiar Linux), use:

   ipkg-buildpackage
