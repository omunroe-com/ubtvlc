Create translations for VLC media player
==============
The translation files are located in the "po" directory of the vlc sources.
Edit the appropriate file (for instance fr.po for French translation).
Write the translation of "msgid" strings into the "msgstr" field.
You can always ask vlc-devel@videolan.org for assistance.


Writing a new localization
==========================
If there is no localization file for your language, send a mail to
vlc-devel@videolan.org. In return we will send you a localization file,
along with a special VLC binary for your tests.


Testing your localization on UNIX
=================================
You must install the gettext package. See your UNIX distribution, or
  http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext
Use the convert-po.sh script attached :
  ./convert-po.sh <LANG>.po
Copy the resulting vlc.mo file to
  /usr/local/share/locale/<LANG>/LC_MESSAGES


Testing your localization on Mac OS X
=====================================
If you do not have GNU gettext installed (you'd probably know if you had
it :), you must download its binaries from our website :
  http://download.videolan.org/pub/videolan/devtools/gettext-macosx.tar.gz
and extract them into the current directory :
  tar xvzf gettext-macosx.tar.gz

Use the convert-po.sh script attached :
  setenv PATH gettext-macosx:$PATH
  setenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=gettext-macosx
  ./convert-po.sh <LANG>.po
[*]

Copy the resulting vlc.mo file to
  VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/locale/<LANG>/LC_MESSAGES


"fuzzy" translations
====================
A fuzzy translation is an untranslated string for which gettext did an
automatic suggestion, but needs your confirmation. They are marked with
the "#, fuzzy" comment. If you think the suggestion is OK, or if you
fixed the suggestion, do not forget to remove the "#, fuzzy" comment.


[*] Step by step process to localize under Mac OS X (excerpt from a mail) :
cd ~/Desktop
curl -O http://www.videolan.org/pub/videolan/devtools/vlc-po-files.tar.gz
tar xzf vlc-po-files.tar.gz
cd vlc-po-files
curl -O http://www.videolan.org/pub/videolan/devtools/gettext-macosx.tar.gz
tar xzf gettext-macosx.tar.gz
setenv PATH ./gettext-macosx:$PATH
setenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH ./gettext-macosx
[here you copy your it.po file to the vlc-po-files folder on your Desktop]
./convert-po.sh it.po
[here you copy the vlc.mo file to your
VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/locale/it/LC_MESSAGES]
