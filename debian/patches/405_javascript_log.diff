    Mozilla: remove logging support
    
    You don't want random web pages listing, say, the content of your
    hard drive (file/xspf-open://C:/ ?). For debugging purpose, the standard
    error from Mozilla is probably better than Javascript anyway, not to
    mention that the libvlc logging APi is really brain-damaged.
