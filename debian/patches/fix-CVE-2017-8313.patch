Description: ParseJSS: fix out-of-bounds read
 The previous loop would continue until a space is found, which of course means
 that it would step out of bounds if the string did not contain such.
 .
 These changes simply terminates the loop if the end of the string is reached.
 .
 This fixes CVE-2017-8313.
