    11. What is "luma"?

    It is useful in a video system to convey a component representative of
    luminance and two other components representative of colour. It is
    important to convey the component representative of luminance in such
    a way that noise (or quantization) introduced in transmission,
    processing and storage has a perceptually similar effect across the
    entire tone scale from black to white. The ideal way to accomplish
    these goals would be to form a luminance signal by matrixing RGB, then
    subjecting luminance to a nonlinear transfer function similar to the
    L* function.

    There are practical reasons in video to perform these operations
    in the opposite order. First a nonlinear transfer function - gamma
    correction - is applied to each of the linear R, G and B. Then a
    weighted sum of the nonlinear components is computed to form a
    signal representative of luminance. The resulting component is
    related to brightness but is not CIE luminance. Many video
    engineers call it luma and give it the symbol Y'. It is often
    carelessly called luminance and given the symbol Y. You must be
    careful to determine whether a particular author assigns a linear
    or nonlinear interpretation to the term luminance and the symbol
    Y.

    The coefficients that correspond to the "NTSC" red, green and blue
    CRT phosphors of 1953 are standardized in ITU-R Recommendation BT.
    601-2 (formerly CCIR Rec.  601-2). I call it Rec.  601. To compute
    nonlinear video luma from nonlinear red, green and blue:

    Y'601 = 0.299R' 0.587G' + 0.114B'

    We will use the integer scaled versions of these numbers below
    as RED_COEF, GREEN_COEF and BLUE_COEF.

   The closest match is determined by the the Euclidean distance

   Actually, we use the square of the Euclidean distance; but in

       square to 10 bits.  Next we scale by 6 to give 16
       bits. XXX_COEF all fit into 5 bits, so when we multiply we
       should have 21 bits maximum. So computations can be done using
       32-bit precision. However before storing back distance
       components we scale back down by 12 bits making the precision 9
       bits. (This checks out since it is basically the range of the
       square of the initial 8-bit value.)

       The squared distance is the sum of three of the 9-bit components
       described above. This then uses 27-bits and also fits in a
       32-bit word.
