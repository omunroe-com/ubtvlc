* Corba module (server) side

** Dependencies

To compile the CORBA plugin, you need the orbit2 developpement files
(for Debian, install the package liborbit2-dev)

** How to run it ?

You run the CORBA module  with the following command line :

vlc --intf corba

The CORBA module is initialized and saves its IOR into the file
/tmp/vlc-ior.ref
(it will soon move to $HOME/.vlc-ior.ref)

** Code architecture

The binding between VLC and the MediaControl API (at C-level) is done
through the mediacontrol-core.c file. This file implements an
object-oriented layer API accessible in C. 

The corba.c itself only translates calls from CORBA to this C API,
which makes the code clearer overall. Moreover, the same
mediacontrol-core.c file is used by the vlc-python module to implement the
same API.

* Client side

A sample client code can be found at http://liris.cnrs.fr/advene/

**  Dependencies

The python client uses the pyorbit library developped by James
Henstridge <james@daa.com.au> 

** Typelib information

To simply access the server, you do not need any reference to the IDL
(CORBA2.0 provides introspection facilities). However, if you want to
use the structures defined in the IDL (Position, Origin, ...), you
need to use the IDL information, and compile a dynamic lib
(MediaControl.so) from the IDL.
