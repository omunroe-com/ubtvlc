Implementation Notes
--------------------

 The union vlc_value_t has been implemented as a hierarchy of classes
which has JVLCVariable.class as the root. All the children of this
class are named JVLC<type>Variable.class and are mapped 1:1 to the
union members with some exceptions: p_address is not implemented since
there's no notion of address in Java, vlc_object_t is not implemented
since I don't know how to represent it in Java and is not defined in
vlc/vlc.h
