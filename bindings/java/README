            First of all, this is a *developers* only version


Usage
-----

 In order to use these bindings you have to compile vlc from source. I
recommend you to take the latest version from videolan svn repository
(or use at least revison 15823) by doing:

svn co svn://svn.videolan.org/vlc/trunk vlc-trunk

 bootstrap, clean, set environment variables, configure and build:

./bootstrap && make distclean

export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jvm 
(for example i have JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/j2sdk1.5-sun)

./configure --enable-java-bindings && make && make install

 If you give a prefix be sure to change the PREFIX variable in the Makefile
from /usr/local to your prefix.

 Once you've done with vlc you can run make in jvlc directory. Be sure
you have gcj, gcjh and if you want to use the SUN Java compiler,
change the Makefile accordingly. You will probably need to change also 

JINCLUDES
LIBJINCLUDES

 In the next releases I will automate this process.

 To run a Java VLC example issue:

java -Djava.library.path=. VlcClient

 Be sure your ldconfig can find libjawt.so and libmawt.so or you will
get linking errors when you run the program.

 Happy playing.
